# **Waterfall Model - Real-World Example & Simple Explanation**

## **Real-World Example: Building a House**

The **Waterfall Model** follows a step-by-step process, like constructing a house:

1. **Requirement Gathering** â†’ Decide what kind of house you need (size, rooms, budget).
2. **System Design** â†’ Create blueprints for structure, plumbing, and electrical layout.
3. **Implementation (Coding)** â†’ Build the foundation, walls, and roof.
4. **Testing** â†’ Inspect wiring, plumbing, and structural integrity.
5. **Deployment** â†’ Move into the house and set up furniture.
6. **Maintenance** â†’ Repair leaks, repaint walls, and fix damages over time.

## **Phases of Waterfall Model (Simple Definition)**

1. **Requirement Gathering** â†’ Collect and document what needs to be built.
2. **System Design** â†’ Plan how the system (or project) will function.
3. **Implementation (Coding)** â†’ Develop and write the actual code.
4. **Testing** â†’ Verify that everything works correctly.
5. **Deployment** â†’ Deliver and install the system for use.
6. **Maintenance** â†’ Fix errors and improve performance after release.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Point:** Waterfall is **linear**â€”you canâ€™t go back to the previous step easily.
